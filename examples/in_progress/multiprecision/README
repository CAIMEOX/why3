The working directory contains two WhyML files :
 - mp2.mlw is our formalization of GMP algorithms
 - lineardecision.mlw contains our decision procedure for linear equation systems (module LinearEquationsDecision) and its specialization to GMP goals (module LinearDecisionIntMP), as well as a few example goals (module TestMP and others).

You can open the Why3 IDE on either file with the following command:
    why3 ide -L . <FILENAME>

All the large blocks of commented code in mp2.mlw (e.g., lines 1810-1853 and 4604-4668) correspond to user-supplied cut indications for assertions that are now proved by reflection.

You may also consult the proof session of mp2.mlw with the command:
    firefox mp2/why3session.html

The goals proved with reflection can be found by searching for "reflection" in the session.


Trying reflection on your own examples

You may add your own examples to the TestMP module (at the end of lineardecision.mlw), and then try to prove them in the Why3 IDE by mimicking the proofs of the existing ones. The Why3 IDE has a builtin text editor, but you can also install your editor of choice with apt-get. The reflection procedure is called with the command "reflection_f mp_decision" in the Why3 IDE command line.


Why3 sources

The directory ~/why3 contains the Why3 sources. Among other things, the reification procedure and the interpreter referenced in the paper can be found in the file ~/why3/src/transform/reification.ml
