  - merge `fun` and `rec`?
    (with a way to refer to the previous identifier with the same name)

## type inference
  - partial outcome? (i.e. with a part that is inferred)
    e.g. bst.mome

## loops
  - `loop` with a call before the defn?
    `where loop`?

 - mutually recursive loops?
      would mean the same outcomes

    rec loop a = ...
    and loop b = ...
    and      c = ...
